# Solar-Tracker
Light-tracking system using 4 LDRs, resistors, servos, and an Arduino. The sensors detect light intensity and the Arduino adjusts two servo motors for azimuth and elevation, keeping the device aligned with the brightest source. A hands-on learning project I feel grateful to be part of, as it initiated me in skills I didn't have before.
