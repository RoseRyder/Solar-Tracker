# Solar-Tracker
Light-tracking system using 4 LDRs, resistors, servos, and an Arduino. The sensors detect light intensity and the Arduino adjusts two servo motors for azimuth and elevation, keeping the device aligned with the brightest source. 
A hands-on learning project I feel grateful to be part of, as it initiated me in skills I didn't have before. 
Contents:
1. Arduino Code
2. STL and DWG files to 3D print the solar panel's frame.
3. STL file for the base doubling as azimuthal servo container.
